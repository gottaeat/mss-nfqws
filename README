build instructions
==================
1. local
--------
./build-openwrt.sh

2. docker
---------
# if the compilation is noticably slower than the local build with the shell
# script up above, that mostly likely is due to the fakeroot process within the
# container choking up, you might want to add:
#   --ulimit "nofile=1024:524288"
# to your docker run args, or change the line
#   LimitNOFILE=infinity
# to
#   LimitNOFILE=1024:524288
# for docker and containerd systemd service files. to learn more, refer to:
#   https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/38814
